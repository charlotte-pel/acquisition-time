# Drawing a timeline displaying (satellite) acquisition dates


This code provides a (na√Øve) tool to draw a timeline that displays acquisition dates for a single area

![example1](fig/example1.png)

or for multiple areas (below Sentinel-2 acquisition dates over three tiles)

![example2](fig/example2.png)

The red dashed lines represent interpolated dates (used to deal with irregular temporal sampling for example).

It might be used to present your (remote sensing) dataset.

## Usage
This code relies on Pyhton 3.7.

Please have a look to the Jupyter notebook `draw-timeline.ipynb` to draw your own timelines.
